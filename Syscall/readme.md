### System call
> In computing, a system call is the programmatic way in which a computer program requests a service from the 
kernel of the operating system it is executed on.<br>
This may include hardware-related services(for example, accessing a hard disk drive), creation and executing of new  processes, and communication with integral kernal service such as process scheduling.<br>
 System calls provide an essential interface between a process and the operating system.
