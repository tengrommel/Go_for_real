What on earth are you talking about?

--- Package
--- Library
--- Program
--- Command

What is a package/library?

Folder full of .go(and hopefully_test.go)files
Can be imported into other projects
Has exported(public) and unexported (internal) stuff
Hopefully open-sourced
Not package main(that's command)

What is a beautiful package?
Elegant & simple
Obvious (maybe even boring)
You already know how to use it
Look forward to using it

Motivation
Do you have the right motivation for writing a package?
Don't write packages for the sake of it
Are you excited to write it or does it sound boring?
If you aren't solving a problem you have, don't bother

Keep packages internal to start with
Don't automatically open-source your packages
Live with them first internally
But design them as if you will one day
